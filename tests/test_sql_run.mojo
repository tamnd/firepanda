"""A query text in, rows out.

Every other test in the SQL front end checks one stage against the stage's own
idea of an answer. The transform tests check SQL printed back, the lowering
tests check the text `explain` produces, and the pipeline tests check frames
built by hand. All of them can pass while the stages do not fit together, which
is what this file is for: it names no stage and asserts nothing about a plan, it
writes a query and checks the rows.

The queries are deliberately small and the numbers are deliberately not in
order, so that a filter that keeps a middle range is not a slice and a sort that
does nothing is visible. The frames have three chunks for the same reason they
do in the pipeline tests, which is that a chunk boundary is where an off by one
in a position lives.

The refusals matter as much as the answers. A shape nothing runs yet has to say
so by name, because a query that quietly returned the wrong rows would be the
kind of defect that only a differential run against DuckDB finds, and a refusal
is something a caller can act on.
